Defined as a group of computers that are linked together with equal permission and responsibilites for processing data. 
The peer-to-peer network has quickly dominated the 21st century's workplace enviorment, reshaped entire industries and
vastly improved connectivity and access to shared resources. The task at hand required us to design a program which allowed
for two or more computers to synchronize fies across a local area network, with each computer being able to run its own local
instance of the client software, and the file.Implenting such a feat would be a lot more difficult.

At the heart of all peer to peer networks lays an equal number of peer nodes that work as both clients and servers 
typically implementing an overlay network.When deciding whether to implement either a unstructured or structed network
we took into consideration that unstructured networks have very poor search sucesses. So in order to tackle these shortcomings 
by using a distributed hash table.

For a group with relatively little experience designing networks,let alone working with distributive systems this project 
allowed us to acquire a substancitated grasp on the content material. For example, as discussed in class no two computers 
inherently operate with the same standardized time we attempted to establish our own local time.However, we would soon have
to abandon said idea due to the unnecessary complexity.
 
A large bulk of this endevour was spent reading the documentaion regarding sockets and hashmaps, as well as variety of 
file handling.Unfortunately, even with the countless hours spent reading documentation we still found ourselves having 
to rework our code because hashmap wasn't properly storing our client or recieving a file.The amount of frustration 
experienced has been imeasurable, at one point we were sending files to the root for like three hours.
